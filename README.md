# SlideSpeak coding challenge: Build a PowerPoint to PDF marketing tool

## The challenge!

Build a front-end implementation as well as a back-end service to convert PowerPoint documents to PDF format. This
should be done by implementing a simple **Next.js** front-end that posts a file to a **Python** server. You donâ€™t have
to do the converting logic yourself as you can use unoconv or unoserver to do this (you can see more about this in the
acceptance criteria). The front-end is also already implemented in the /frontend folder. You only need to add the
necessary logic to switch between the steps and convert the file via the API that you're going to build.

## Acceptance criteria

### Back-end API

- Should be implemented in Python.
- Converting PowerPoints to PDF can be done with `unoconv` or `unoserver` via Docker if you want to be fancy ðŸ˜€. You
  donâ€™t need to implement the converting logic yourself.
  - [How to use unoserver via docker](https://gist.github.com/kgoedecke/44955d0b0b1ed4112bcfd3e237e135c0), this will
    create an API that you can use based on [this](https://github.com/libreofficedocker/unoserver-rest-api)
    documentation.
    - Using unoserver is nice-to-have (but the preferred way), if you find unoconv easier use it instead
- Under the the hood the API:

  1. Convert the attached file to PDF
  2. Upload the PowerPoint and PDF file to Amazon S3
     via [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
  3. Create a presigned URL for the user to download

     [https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html)

     [https://medium.com/@aidan.hallett/securing-aws-s3-uploads-using-presigned-urls-aa821c13ae8d](https://medium.com/@aidan.hallett/securing-aws-s3-uploads-using-presigned-urls-aa821c13ae8d)

  4. Return the presigned S3 url to the client which allows the user to download the file (by opening the url in new
     tab)

- Queuing to process multiple requests at a time

### Front-end app

- The front-end should in terms of UX work similarly
  to [https://app.slidespeak.co/powerpoint-optimizer](https://app.slidespeak.co/powerpoint-optimizer)

## General Requirements:

- Use conventional commit message style: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
- Lint your code
- Keep commits clean

## Nice to haves / tips

- Uses unoserver to convert PowerPoint to PDF via docker compose
- The logic of the front-end ideally should not rely on useEffect too much since it can be difficult to track what is
  happening
- Tests
- API documentation
